## Cyclistic_Bike_Share_Analysis

A capstone project as part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate. The program briefly taught R, but I will be utilizing Python to analyze the dataset instead.

### Objective

Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago, and the Director of Marketing believes that future success is dependent on maximizing the number of annual memberships. As a Junior Data Analyst, it will be my job to understand how casual riders and annual members differ. From these insights, the team will design a marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members as they are much more profitable.

### Data

Public data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). There are 12 datasets for Cyclistic's historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. As Cyclistic is a fictional company, these datasets are appropriate for the purposes of this case study and will allow me to answer the business questions.

### Tools

- Python: Various libraries were utilized for creating dataframes and visualizations. These include: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Jupyter Notebook: Scripts containing all the steps taken to wrangle and clean data, as well as create different types of charts/graphs.

### Results
